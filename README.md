# MapEX

**MapEX** is a graphical application for performing **phase mapping** of elemental maps using secondary X-rays using advanced clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques.

It supports common methods like:
- KMeans, GMM, FCM, Hierarchical clustering
- PCA-based dimensionality reduction
- Density-based clustering: Mean Shift, DBSCAN, Affinity Propagation

MapEX helps researchers preprocess, analyze, and visualize complex elemental data interactively.
